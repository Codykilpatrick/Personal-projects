This project is for the Supervised Machine Learning: Classification final projects

About dataset:
We are going to try and predict if a power line is faulted and what kind of fault it is based on Line current per phase,
Line Voltage per phase.

There are two sets, one that specifies specific fault categories and one that is a binary fault condition.
Here we will tackle the categorical one first.
