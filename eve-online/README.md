Eve Online is a Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game. Players are set in the far future and tasked with piloting spaceships to make money (ISK) and do whatever they desire. Players are able to come together to form corporations, then corporations of like minded players form alliances. Eve online has a completely player driver market, that means everything is created and destroyed within the game with very few external injections.
