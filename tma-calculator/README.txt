When conducting ASW operations there is a process called Target Motion Analysis and it contains math
lots of math. Mostly Trigonometry and multiple equations that feed into each other.

The flow of this process is:
1. Receive frequency and note which direction its from
2. Find our estimate the true radiated frequency
3. Calculate how much that frequency shifts due to one knot of speed
4. Find or guess the contact speed
5. Find your own speed

After that the math comes in. As a receiver and a source move towards each other frequency increases.
6. Calculate out how much you are impacting the received frequency
7. Calculate how much the contact is impacting the received frequency
8. Once you do that you can take the difference between the true radiated frequency and subtract your impact and get a course for the contact

All this takes about three minutes of time, a white board, either raw math or some aids that do the Trigonometry for you. But this is all
prone to human error.

The objective of this program is to remove almost all of the possible human errors and to reduce time.
